# ABOUT 
Implementation for Alura's challenge with JavaFX UI. It was devided in two projects:
1. ImersaoAlura: project that aims extracting IMDb API information for previous use (e.g. sticker maker);
2. APIViewer: project that provide an user interface for edit and save stickers from movie covers.

## More than just 'Sticker Maker'
The current project can be used for get and edit another APIs, thanks the use of Generics and modularization.
Feel free to edit it as you wish.
